# Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Abagi Godsway, and I am currently exploring GitHub as part of a learning task. I enjoy learning about technology and improving my coding skills. 

I am excited to use GitHub to manage my projects, collaborate with others, and track my progress. This is my first repository, and Iâ€™m looking forward to learning more!
